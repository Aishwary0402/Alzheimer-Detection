üß† Alzheimer's Disease Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease based on a comprehensive set of patient data. Using various machine learning models, this analysis explores different classification techniques to determine the most effective approach for early detection.

üìñ Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to build and evaluate several machine learning models for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. The process involves thorough data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the implementation of multiple classification algorithms. The performance of each model is assessed using key metrics to identify the most accurate and reliable method for prediction.

Key Features:

1) Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and scaling numerical features.

2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes the data to understand the distribution and relationships between different patient attributes.

3) Model Implementation: Applies a range of classification models, including:

        Logistic Regression

        Decision Tree

        Random Forest

        Support Vector Machine (SVM)

        K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

        Gradient Boosting

4) Performance Evaluation: Measures the effectiveness of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5) Confusion Matrix Visualization: Provides a clear visual representation of the performance of the top models.

‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

The project follows a structured approach to model development and evaluation:

1) Data Loading and Cleaning: The alzheimers_disease_data.csv dataset is loaded, and initial preprocessing steps are performed to ensure data quality. Unnecessary columns like PatientID and DoctorInCharge are dropped.

2) Exploratory Data Analysis: Box plots and other visualizations are used to check for outliers and understand the data's characteristics.

3) Feature Scaling: Numerical features are scaled using MinMaxScaler to normalize the data and prepare it for model training.

4) Model Training: The data is split into training and testing sets, and six different classification models are trained on the training data.

5) Model Evaluation: Each model's performance is evaluated on the test set, and the results are compiled into a comparative table to highlight the most effective algorithms.

6) Visualization: Confusion matrices for the top-performing models are plotted to provide a detailed view of their predictive accuracy.

üíæ Dataset

The analysis is performed on the alzheimers_disease_data.csv dataset, which contains various patient attributes, including:

        Demographic information (Age, Gender, Ethnicity, Education Level)

        Health metrics (BMI, Smoking, Alcohol Consumption, Physical Activity)
